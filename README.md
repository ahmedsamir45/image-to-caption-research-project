# image-to-caption-research-project

This is a graduation project focused on generating image captions using deep learning models. It explores and utilizes various pretrained models including **CNN**, **RNN**, and **LSTM** to build an end-to-end image captioning system.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:
- **Frontend**: User interface to upload images and display generated captions.
- **Backend**: Model inference and caption generation logic using pretrained deep learning models.

## Getting Started

### Frontend

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedsamir45/image-to-caption-research-project.git
cd image-to-caption-research-project
git switch frontend
````

### Backend

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedsamir45/image-to-caption-research-project.git
cd image-to-caption-research-project
git switch backend
```

## Technologies Used

* **CNN** (e.g., ResNet, Inception) for image feature extraction
* **RNN / LSTM** for sequence modeling and caption generation
* **Flask** or **FastAPI** (backend)
* **React** or **HTML/CSS/JS** (frontend)
