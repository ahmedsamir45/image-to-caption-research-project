# Automatic Image Captioning using PyTorch on COCO Dataset  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on generating captions for images using a neural network architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as the Encoder and Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) networks as the Decoder. The model is trained on the Microsoft Common Objects in Context [(MS COCO)](http://cocodataset.org/#home) dataset.  

The architecture follows the encoder-decoder approach, where the CNN encoder extracts image features, and the RNN decoder generates captions word by word. This project is inspired by the paper "[Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf)".

After training, the model is evaluated on unseen images to assess its captioning ability.

## Environment Setup  
The model was developed and trained on Google Colab to ensure it can run independently of any environment. It is deployed using Gradio on Windows, and can also be run on Linux and macOS with minor modifications.  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Sreeja-Nukarapu/Automatic-Image-Captioning-using-PyTorch-on-COCO-Dataset.git
cd Automatic-Image-Captioning-using-PyTorch-on-COCO-Dataset
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment  
Create and activate a new environment named `captioning_env` using Python 3.10:  
```shell
conda create -n captioning_env python=3.10
conda activate captioning_env  
```

### 3. Install Dependencies  
Ensure all required libraries are installed, including PyTorch, torchvision, nltk, and Matplotlib:  
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Open Jupyter Notebooks  
Navigate to the project directory and launch Jupyter Notebooks:  
```shell
cd Automatic-Image-Captioning-using-PyTorch-on-COCO-Dataset
open Automatic_Image_Captioner.ipynb
```

Ensure that the kernel is set to the `captioning_env` environment (`Kernel > Change Kernel > captioning_env`).

## Dataset: MS COCO  
The **Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO)** dataset is widely used for scene understanding tasks like object detection, segmentation, and image captioning.  

### Dataset Setup  
1. Clone the COCO API:  
```shell
git clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git
cd cocoapi/PythonAPI  
make  
cd ..
```

2. Download the following from [MS COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#download):
   - **Annotations**: `captions_train2014.json`, `captions_val2014.json`, and `image_info_test2014.json`
   - **Images**: `train2014`, `val2014`, and `test2014`  

Organize the files as follows:  
```
cocoapi/
│
├── annotations/
│   ├── captions_train2014.json
│   ├── captions_val2014.json
│   └── image_info_test2014.json
│
└── images/
    ├── train2014/
    ├── val2014/
    └── test2014/
```

## Model Architecture  
The image captioning model employs an **Encoder-Decoder** architecture:  
- **Encoder**: A pre-trained ResNet CNN extracts image features. The last fully connected layer is replaced with a new trainable layer for compatibility with the RNN decoder.  
- **Decoder**: An RNN network generates captions using the encoded image features and previous words.  

![Encoder-Decoder Architecture](images/archmodel.png)  

### Key Features:  
- **Pre-trained ResNet50**: As the CNN encoder, leveraging pre-learned features from ImageNet.  
- **RNN Decoder**: Captions are generated word by word using the hidden states and image features.  
- **Embedding Layer**: Both image features and words are embedded to the same dimension (`embed_size`) before being fed into the RNN.  

### Training Details:  
- **Loss Function**: Cross Entropy Loss for caption generation.  
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer for efficient weight updates.  
- **Hyperparameters**:  
  - `batch_size`: 64  
  - `vocab_threshold`: 5  
  - `embed_size`: 256  
  - `hidden_size`: 512  
  - `num_epochs`: 3  
  - `learning_rate`: 1e-3
